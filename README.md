# 8bit-labels
Labels for Ben Eater inspired 8-bit breadboard computer
# What's here?
A GIMP file with various labels and a ready to print PDF.
The file is 8.5x11". Best to print with Adobe Reader and make sure "Actual size" is selected.
These are designed to be printed, cut out, and taped in the appropriate locations. The control word labels are designed to be taped (transparent tape) or glued (maybe with a clear school glue stick) on top of a standard 10 segment LED bargraph. I used tape
# Modifying Bargraph labels
To change these, you would:
1) Change the appopriate text layer under /Bar/Texts folder
2) Copy that text layer to /Bar/Rot Texts folder
3) Transform layer by rotating 180 deg
4) Adjust position as you see fit, turning on grid visibility should help.

A bit tedious, but this is how it's accomplished in GIMP.
